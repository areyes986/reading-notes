## Auth.Net/Reading Tech Docs

**How to read technical documents**  
1. Why are you reading it?
2. Get the structure of the doc and briefly look over table of contexts and chapter intros.
3. Scan the document. Look at pictures and things you immediately understand
4. Stop when it gets boring.
5. Look at the table of contents again, you will understand it more after you have scanned the entire doc.
