## Relational Databases

A Database is a collection of data. It has facts and figures that can give us information. A Database management system stores that data and makes it easy to get, produce, and manipulation information.
Some Database Management System characteristics:  
- Real-world entity - A DBMS uses real-world entities to design the architecture.
- Relation-based tables - Allows entities to form tables. 
- Query Language - you can use query language with DBMS and it makes it easier to get and manipulate data. You can apply a lot of filtering options to get a set of data.

There are different users of DBMS:
- Administrator - they maintain the DBMS and administrating the database. They have to look at its usage and who uses it. They look for system license and other required tools.
- Designers - They design the databases and watch what data is kept and the formatting as well. They identify and design entities, relations, constraints, and views.
- End users - these are the viewers who pay attention to logs and market raters to other users.
