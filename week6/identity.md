## Identity

This adds login functionality to our applications. Users will be able to create accounts with login info stored in Identity. We can also use external logins such as Facebook, Google, GitHub. It is configured using a SQL server database to store the user informations like the usernames and passwords.  
By using UseAuthentication(), you are adding middleware to the request pipeline.
